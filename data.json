It keeps track of characteristics unique to each bacteria, such as fertility and plasmid factor, as well as its type, and simulates the process for up to 10000 different types of bacteria.",

Experience the thrill of playing with your friends or against computer players, as you shuffle and deal the deck to begin a new round. With pseudo-random shuffling for fair gameplay. The game features a simple yet challenging computer player, who always makes the first legal play in their hand, and discards the first card in their hand if they have no legal plays. As a human player, you will get 8 lines of information about the cards on the table, in each suit, and your own hand, including legal plays. With 5 different commands available - play, discard, deck, quit, and ragequit - you have complete control over your gameplay strategy. At the end of the round, each player's discards will be shown, along with their score. The game ends when one player accumulates 80 points or more, and the player with the lowest score wins. Get ready for endless hours of fun with 4 player Straights game!",
